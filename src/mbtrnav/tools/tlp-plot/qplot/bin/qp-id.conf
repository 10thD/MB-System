#!/opt/local/bin/bash

# NOTE:
# Requires bash >=4.x, which implements associative arrays
# Typically, bash is located in /usr/bin.
# On OSX, default (/usr/bin) bash is 3.x,
# which does not implement associative arrays.
# Macports or Brew may be used to install
# bash v4.x, which has associative arrays.

# Naming Convention:
# QU_ prefix for user environment prevents
# naming conflicts
# QP_ prefix denotes qplot environment/variables

# This file is an example of additional configuration
# for qplot.
# It could be used in addition to the qplot config file
# to contain environment that is shared with other
# scripts. It could also contain dynamic content
# generated by other scripts.

# Example: Array of plot series labels
# used in qplot config
