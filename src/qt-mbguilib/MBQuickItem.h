  /**
     MBQuickItem connects GUI thread with render thread by responding to signals
     emitted by QML renderer. It encapsulates a SurfaceRenderer object, which renders
     a non-QML 3D surface using "native" OpenGL calls. The SurfaceRenderer drawing is 
     rendered first, and underlays QML GUI elements.
     Based on D'Angelo's MyQuickView example:
     https://www.kdab.com/integrate-opengl-code-qt-quick-2-applications-part-2/
     This class inherits QQuickItem so that it may be incoporated by ApplicationWindow.
